\section*{\sc introduction}
\indent \indent Physical conditions in nebulae (planetary nebulae, large HII regions) 
are usually obtained using so called diagnostic method, that allows to obtain average 
the electron temperature $T_e$ and density $N_e$ from different emission line intensities ratios 
(see, f.e., DIAGN method \cite{DIAGN}). However, in case of diagnostic methods 
obtained $T_e$ and $N_e$ are constant within investigated ionization zone. 
For detailed analysis of the ionization structure of nebular environment 
the transfer of the ionizing radiation taking into account all elementary processes
in nebular plasmas important for such transfer should be calculated.
Such calculations are performed during PhM of nebular environment.

In case of nebulae with compact ionization source (f.e star, compact stars cluster, etc) 
radiation can be separated into two components:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Direct component, comming from ionizing source;
\item Diffuse component, originating from nebular gas.
\end{enumerate}

While transfer of the direct component of the ionizing radiation can be easy calculated
(because of no source terms), the diffuse radiation transfer calculation 
is a very time consuming even for modern supercomputers, 
since it requires iterative process of ionizing radiation flux integration over volume 
in each elementary cell of nebula environment \ref{figDet}. For time economy purpouses approximate methods 
of diffuse radiation calculation are frequently used. The most popular are {\b OTS} approximation, 
that assumes that ionizing radiation is consumed into the same volume where it whas emited, 
and {\b Outward Only} approximation, that assumes that ionizing radiation is propogated 
in radial direction, from ionizing source to outer surface of object. However, OTS method 
is good only in case of optically thick objects. Outward only approximation is more precise, 
however it can be inacurate in case of objects with complicated morphology. 
For example, dense clumps can cause the origination of shaded regions behind of them.
Non-radial DIR can play main role in formation of the ionization structure in these shaded
regions.





To avoid usage of approximate methods for DIR calculation and reduce time, 
required for PhM we developed {\b DiffRay3D}) software, that allows to integrate
radiation fluxes using 2D or 3D emissivity maps, and, as result, to implement 
method for detailed diffuse radiation calculation, described in \cite{JPS2016}
and displayed in Figure \ref{our_approach}.

\indent4 - Running PhM code, using fluxes, obtained after step 3. Generating and saving new emissivity and opacity maps.\\
\indent5 - Check difference between electron temperatures obtained from current iteration and the previous one. Once difference is greater than is required by precision, pointed in 1, then returning to step 3.\\

\section{DiffRay3D. General algorithm and limitations}

Current DiffRay3D version provides tools for radiation fluxes integration 
using 2D maps over 3D volume (3D maps support will be implemented in next code
versions). Nebula is divided onto 80 sectors (20 per quoter, assuming cylinder 
symethry and physical conditions in each quoter are the same). Each sector divided 
onto slabs. Shell structure is defined from input emissivity/opacity maps.

General code algorithm is displayed below:

\end{figure}


For diffuse radiation fluxes integration procedure implementation DiffRay code was developed. The algorithm of code is given on figure \ref{diffray_algo}.\\
\indent1 - Setting up initial integration steps for angles, reading emissivity and opacity maps, that should be integrated.\\
\indent2 - Integration of diffuse radiation fluxes for each elementary volume of nebula environment\\
\indent3 - Comparing if difference between fluxes, obtained on current iteration and previous one. If it fits required precision, exit to 5. Elsewise, decreasing integration step (4), and returning to 2.\\
\indent5 - Print fluxes in format, that can be readen by PhM code. Exit.\\

\section{How to launch code}

To run code, you need working compiled code version, and valid object data with 
commands file provided.

\subsection{Code compilation}
1. Download code archive.\\
2. Unzip files in any folder you wish. DiffRay3D can be started into any folder, 
the only demand is code should have enough permissions for create/delete folders 
and files.\\
3. Once unzipped, go to "source/v*.*.*/" folder, and run MakeFile.all. This should
create DiffRay3D.exe executable into instalation root folder.\\

\subsection{Input data format}
To work correctly, code should have information about objects geometry, emissivity and opacity maps,
so on. This information is readen from data folder. In general, filename looks like:

Emis\_Lines\_SectorNo{\bf Sector number}\_Age{\bf Object age}Myr.dat

Here Sector number is number of represented by file sector
Age can be used as any identifier for model data set. (F.E. once you have maps for several models,
you can enumarate them, and use this numeration in age field.

Complete list of supported data files:

{\bf Continuum1\_Last\_Age10.00Myr.dat} - file with continuum energy mesh structure. 
Each row should contain into first column continuum cell energy in Rydbergs. 
File is required.

{\bf Emis\_Cont\_SectorNo1\_Age10.00Myr.dat} - file with continuum emissivity data. Each row 
corresponds to sector slab. First row has only one value - inner radius. Next rows contain slab outer radius in first column, 
and emissivity values for each energy cell in following columns. File is required.

{\bf Opac\_Cont\_SectorNo1\_Age10.00Myr.dat} - file with opacity data for each continuum cell. Each row 
corresponds to sector slab. First row has only one value - inner radius. Next rows contain slab outer radius in first column, 
and opacity values for each energy cell in following columns. Used both for continuum and lines optical depth calculation. 
File is required.

{\bf Emis\_Lines\_SectorNo1\_Age10.00Myr.dat} - file with lines emissivity data. Each row 
corresponds to sector slab. First 2 rows has heading, according to standart Cloudy 
"punch line emisivity" command, \cite{Cloudy}. Next rows contain slab outer radius in first column, 
and emissivity values for each emission line in following columns. File is required.

{\bf Abund1\_Age10.00Myr.dat} - file with elemental aundances data. Each row 
corresponds to sector slab. First row should have valid column headings
with element names, provided as first 4 symbols of full name. 
(\#Depth		H	HELI	LITH	BERY..., Garry Ferlands Cloudy output 
format, see \cite{Cloudy}).
Next rows contain slab outer radius in first column, 
and elemental abundances for each element in following columns. File is not required.

\subsection{commands.ini file}

Once you have compiled code and prepared data files, you should write some 
instructions for how and what code should calculated. These instructions are 
contained into commands.ini file into instalation root directory. 

An example is distributed with code source. \\

{\bf IO settings}\\
print directory "path to your output folder, relative to instalation root directory"\\
input directory "path to input data files folder, relative to instalation root directory"\\

Example:\\
print directory result/ngc/ism0/140\\
input directory data/ngc1569nograin\\
Please, note that paths should be provided without quotes!\\

{\bf Distance}\\
distance log10\_dist units.\\

Example:\\ 
distance 19.87 km \\
(Distance to object is adopted of $10^{19.87}$ kilometers.
Supported units are meters, kilometers, centimeters.

{\bf Object}\\
phi x , x - objects azimuthal rotation angle relating to observer sight ray in radians;\\
theta x , x - objects vertical rotation angle relating to observer sight ray in radians;\\
age x, x - object age, or another models bundle identifier;\\

Example:\\
object phi 0.76\\
object theta 0.21\\
object age 50\\

{\bf Integration}\\
maxiterations x, x - maximum code iterations. This option is useful to prevent code
falling into endless loop when trying to converge.\\
precision x, x - acceptable convergence between iterations, 0.01 - 1\%.
mode outw - switches code to Outward Only mode, is good thing for tests.\\

Example:\\
integration precision 0.005\\
integration maxiterations 12\\

{\bf Aperture}\\

aperture phi theta w h - Adds aperture to list of apertures to be calculated. 
Here phi - azimuthal aperture position, theta - vertical position relative to ray
from observer to center of object. w, h - aperture width and height. All values
should be provided into radians.\\

Example:\\
apperture add 0 0 0.000014537 0.000014537\\
apperture add 0.000464 0.0000139 0.000014537 0.000014537\\
apperture add -0.000271 -0.0000102 0.000014537 0.000014537\\
In this example code will run calculations for 3 apertures, and put results to 
app\{N\} folder. N is aperture number here. Aperture folders are created automatically
into directory, specified with output command.
